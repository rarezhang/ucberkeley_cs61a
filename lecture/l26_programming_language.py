# programming languages
# machine language: a fixed set of instructions invoke operations implemented by the circuitry of the central processing unit
# high-level languages: statements and expression are interpreted by another program or compiled into another language (naming, function definition, objects) -> independent of hardware and operating system

## syntax
## semantics

# create a new programming language
## specification
## canonical implementation

# interpreters
## reading scheme lists: elements in parentheses
## (+(*3(+(*2 4)(+ 3 5)))(+(-10 7) 6))
## coercing a string representation of an expression to the expression itself
## validate the expressions are well-formed

# parsing
## takes text and returns an expression
## text -> tokens

# lexical analysis
# iterative processing
## checks for malformed tokens
## determines types of tokens
## process one line at a time
# syntactic analysis
# tree recursive process
## balances parentheses
## returns tree structure
## process multiple lines
